**WHY Custom Question Answering?**

- **When you have static information** - Use custom question answering when you have static information in your project. This project is custom to your needs, which you've built with documents such as PDFs and URLs.
- **When you want to provide the same answer to a request, question, or command** - when different users submit the same question, the same answer is returned.
- **When you want to filter static information based on meta-information** - add metadata tags to provide additional filtering options relevant to your client application's users and the information. Common metadata information includes chit-chat, content type or format, content purpose, and content freshness.
